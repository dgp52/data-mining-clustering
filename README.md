This report focuses on the raw dataset of criminal complaints
to the New York City Police Department. This data
research was chosen to analyze because it happens to be a
very topical subject at this time. All the complaints given in
this dataset are from 2006 to the end of 2019. It includes
many attributes such as suspect’s age group, suspect’s race
description, victim’s age group, victim’s race description,
name of the borough where the incident took place, and many
more. Full list of coded attributes including the raw data in
a CSV format and footnotes are available on the website of
NYC open data. <br>
The purpose of this report is to identify groups of complaints
by using various attributes given in the dataset. Using those
groups, we can identify the types of crime along with location,
age, race, and gender. Each cluster has different traits of their
own, and in some cases, they overlap with each other. In this
report, the representation of clustering is done on a 2d space.
In addition, this report also applies two different methods for
clustering nominal data.
